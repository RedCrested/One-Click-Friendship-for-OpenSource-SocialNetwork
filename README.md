# One-Click Friendship for OpenSource-SocialNetwork

This component designed for OpenSource-SocialNetork (OSSN) display a button on the news feed to allow the user to add another user as a friend directly from the timeline. 

After the user send the friend request, it's possible to cancel the request directly. If the users are friends, the button showed allow them to remove the friendship. These last two buttons can be disabled by editing the params.php file. Also, on this file, it's possible to customize the icons or show buttons instead.
